```yaml
# Sprint 1 (Data Acquisition)
Workers: 50 concurrent
Database: PostgreSQL with basic indexes
Cache: Redis for deduplication
Storage: Local filesystem with compression
Scrapers: 50+ active sources

# Sprint 2 (Optimization + AI)
Workers: 100+ concurrent
Database: PostgreSQL + Read replicas + Partitioning
Cache: Redis cluster with multi-level caching
Storage: Local + S3 + CDN for media
Search: Elasticsearch cluster (3+ nodes)
ML: GPU instances for inference
```

### Data Growth Timeline
- **End of Sprint 1 Week 1**: 250,000 documents
- **End of Sprint 1**: 500,000+ documents
- **End of Sprint 2 Week 1**: 1,000,000 documents
- **End of Sprint 2**: 2,000,000+ documents

### Priority Stack

#### Sprint 1 Priorities
1. **Must Have**: 
   - 500k+ documents from reliable sources
   - 50+ active scrapers
   - RSS aggregation working
   - Basic deduplication
2. **Nice to Have**:
   - Forum crawling
   - International sources
   - Advanced monitoring

#### Sprint 2 Priorities
1. **Must Have**:
   - Elasticsearch integration
   - Semantic search in production
   - Medical NER extraction
   - <100ms search latency
2. **Should Have**:
   - GraphQL API
   - AI summarization
   - Cross-source linking
   - Social media integration
3. **Stretch Goals**:
   - GPT-4/Claude integration
   - Medical knowledge graph
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Predictive analytics

### Storage Estimates
- **Sprint 1**: ~500GB compressed data
- **Sprint 2**: ~2TB with multimedia content
- **Embeddings**: ~100GB for 2M documents
- **Elasticsearch**: ~1TB indexed data

### Scraper Configuration
```python
# Sprint 1 - Aggressive crawling
CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY = 50
RATE_LIMITS = {
    'pubmed_bulk': None,  # No limit
    'rss_feeds': 10.0,   # 10/second
    'forums': 2.0,       # Respectful
}

# Sprint 2 - Optimized for scale
CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY = 100
BATCH_SIZES = {
    'bulk_import': 5000,
    'embedding_generation': 1000,
    'elasticsearch_index': 2000
}
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Quality**: Implement relevance scoring early
- **Storage Costs**: Use compression and tiered storage
- **API Rate Limits**: Rotate API keys, implement backoff
- **AI Costs**: Cache embeddings, use quantized models
- **Legal**: Respect robots.txt, implement opt-out
