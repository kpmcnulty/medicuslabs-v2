# Medical Data Platform TODO - Updated Status (As of 2025-07-13)


## üöß Phase 1.5: Expand Data Collection & Define Strategy (CURRENT SPRINT)

### üî¥ High Priority - Fix Data Collection (2/5 scrapers working)
- [ ] **Fix Existing Broken Scrapers**
  - [x] Reddit scraper implemented but needs API credentials in .env
  - [ ] HealthUnlocked communities (web.py exists, config exists, NOT integrated)
  - [ ] Patient.info forums (web.py exists, config exists, NOT integrated)
- [ ] **Add High-Value Medical Sources**
  - [ ] European Medicines Agency (EMA) database - NOT STARTED
  - [ ] Medical journals with open APIs (PLOS, BMJ Open) - NOT STARTED

### üìä Current Data Status: ONLY 8 DOCUMENTS (Goal: 100+)




## üü¢ Phase 2.5: Semantic Search (NOT STARTED - pgvector ready but unused)

- [ ] Implement embedding generation for all documents
  - [ ] Choose embedding model (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - [ ] Batch process existing documents
  - [ ] Add to scraping pipeline
- [ ] Add semantic search endpoint (/api/search/semantic)
- [ ] Implement hybrid search (combine full-text + semantic)
- [ ] Add relevance scoring with adjustable weights
- [ ] Note: pgvector extension installed but not utilized

## üü¢ Phase 3: AI-Powered Insights & NLP Analytics (Future)

- [ ] **Medical Entity Recognition (NER)**
  - [ ] Extract medications, dosages, side effects
  - [ ] Identify medical conditions, symptoms
  - [ ] Extract treatment outcomes
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**
  - [ ] Patient sentiment towards treatments
  - [ ] Side effect severity analysis
  - [ ] Treatment satisfaction scoring
- [ ] **Clinical Trial Intelligence**
  - [ ] Auto-summarize trial results
  - [ ] Compare similar trials
  - [ ] Extract key inclusion/exclusion criteria
- [ ] **Adverse Event Detection**
  - [ ] Real-time monitoring for safety signals
  - [ ] Severity classification
  - [ ] FDA MedDRA coding suggestions

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Admin & Management (COMPLETED EARLY!)

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- [x] **Full Admin Portal** at http://localhost:3000/admin
- [x] **JWT Authentication** with secure login
- [x] **Source Management** - Add/edit/configure sources with visual indicators
  - [x] üîó Linked sources (disease-specific)
  - [x] üîç Search sources (search all diseases)
- [x] **Disease Management** - Configure search terms and synonyms
  - [x] Tag-based search term editor
  - [x] Visual search preview
  - [x] Disease merging functionality
- [x] **Job Monitoring** - View and trigger scraping jobs
- [x] **Dashboard** - Real-time statistics and system health
- [x] **Scheduling** - Configure scraper schedules

### üî¥ Still Missing
- [ ] Data quality monitoring metrics
- [ ] Export capabilities

## üü¢ Phase 5: Performance & Polish (Future) ?

- [ ] Add caching for metadata schemas and common values
- [ ] Optimize data table for large datasets (virtualization)
- [ ] Add search analytics/telemetry
- [ ] Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, PDF reports)

## üìä Current State Summary (Updated 2025-07-13)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Dynamic Search Interface** - Fully functional with source selection, disease filtering, adaptive columns
- **Advanced API** - Metadata discovery, dynamic values, complex filtering
- **Working Scrapers** - ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed (Reddit needs API creds)
- **Database** - PostgreSQL with full-text search, JSON metadata, pgvector ready
- **Docker Deployment** - All services running with docker-compose
- **Admin Portal** - Complete source/disease management, job monitoring, JWT auth

### üî¥ Critical Gaps
1. **Data Collection** - Only 2/5 scrapers working, ONLY 8 DOCUMENTS (need 100+)
2. **Forum Scrapers** - HealthUnlocked & Patient.info configs exist but NOT integrated
3. **FDA FAERS** - High-value adverse event data Done
4. **Smart Query Builder** - Partially implemented, needs integration
5. **Data Normalization** - No pipeline defined

### üü° Implementation Status by Phase
- **Phase 1** ‚úÖ Core Search - COMPLETE
- **Phase 1.5** üöß Data Collection - IN PROGRESS 
- **Phase 2** Query Builder -  DONE
- **Phase 2.5** ‚ùå Semantic Search - NOT STARTED (pgvector unused)
- **Phase 3** ‚ùå NLP/AI - NOT STARTED
- **Phase 4** ‚úÖ Admin Portal - COMPLETE 
- **Phase 5** ‚ùå Performance - NOT STARTED

### üéØ Next Sprint Goals
1. Fix Reddit, HealthUnlocked, Patient.info scrapers
2. Add FDA FAERS scraper for adverse events
3. Implement visual query builder with dynamic schema
4. Expand to 100+ documents across all sources
5. Define data normalization pipeline

### üî¥ User Experience Improvements - High Priority
  1. add bakc 'detail view' with expanded stuff'
