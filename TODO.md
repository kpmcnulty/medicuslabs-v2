# Medical Data Platform TODO - Updated Status (As of 2025-07-21)


## üöß Phase 1.5: Expand Data Collection & Define Strategy (CURRENT SPRINT)

### üî¥ High Priority - Fix Data Collection (4/7 scrapers working)
- [ ] **Working Scrapers**
  - [x] ClinicalTrials.gov - Fully functional with API v2
  - [x] PubMed - Enhanced with full metadata extraction  
  - [x] FDA FAERS - Adverse event reporting system
  - [x] Reddit - Implemented but needs API credentials:
    - `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
    - `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` 
    - `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`
- [ ] **Ready but NOT Integrated**
  - [ ] HealthUnlocked - WebScraper class exists, config exists, needs seeds.sql entry
  - [ ] Patient.info - WebScraper class exists, config exists, needs seeds.sql entry
- [ ] **Not Started**
  - [ ] European Medicines Agency (EMA) database
  - [ ] PLOS (Public Library of Science) journals
  - [ ] BMJ Open medical journals
  - [ ] PubMed Central (PMC) full-text articles
  - [ ] ClinicalKey or other medical databases





## üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED (To reach 100+ documents)

1. **Quick Data Population**
   - [ ] Add Reddit API credentials to .env file
   - [ ] Add HealthUnlocked & Patient.info to seeds.sql with web_scraper type
   - [ ] Run full scrape on all working sources
   - [ ] Create pre-scraped JSON archives for quick seeding

2. **Integration Tasks** 
   - [ ] Connect web scrapers to main pipeline (update task_map in scrapers.py)
   - [ ] Test HealthUnlocked scraper with existing config
   - [ ] Test Patient.info scraper with existing config
   - [ ] Add source entries to database for new scrapers

## üü¢ Phase 2.5: Semantic Search (NOT STARTED - pgvector ready but unused)

- [ ] **Infrastructure** (pgvector column exists: embedding vector(384))
  - [ ] Choose embedding model (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - [ ] Create embedding generation service
  - [ ] Add batch embedding job to Celery
- [ ] **Implementation**
  - [ ] Generate embeddings for existing documents
  - [ ] Add embedding generation to scraping pipeline
  - [ ] Create semantic search endpoint (/api/search/semantic)
  - [ ] Build hybrid search (combine full-text + semantic)
  - [ ] Add similarity threshold and relevance scoring
- [ ] **Optimization**
  - [ ] Add IVFFlat or HNSW index for vector similarity
  - [ ] Implement embedding caching
  - [ ] Add query expansion with synonyms

## üü¢ Phase 3: AI-Powered Insights & NLP Analytics (Future)

- [ ] **Medical Entity Recognition (NER)**
  - [ ] Extract medications, dosages, side effects
  - [ ] Identify medical conditions, symptoms
  - [ ] Extract treatment outcomes
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**
  - [ ] Patient sentiment towards treatments
  - [ ] Side effect severity analysis
  - [ ] Treatment satisfaction scoring
- [ ] **Clinical Trial Intelligence**
  - [ ] Auto-summarize trial results
  - [ ] Compare similar trials
  - [ ] Extract key inclusion/exclusion criteria
- [ ] **Adverse Event Detection**
  - [ ] Real-time monitoring for safety signals
  - [ ] Severity classification
  - [ ] FDA MedDRA coding suggestions

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Admin & Management (COMPLETED EARLY!)

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- [x] **Full Admin Portal** at http://localhost:3000/admin
- [x] **JWT Authentication** with secure login
- [x] **Source Management** - Add/edit/configure sources with visual indicators
  - [x] üîó Linked sources (disease-specific)
  - [x] üîç Search sources (search all diseases)
- [x] **Disease Management** - Configure search terms and synonyms
  - [x] Tag-based search term editor
  - [x] Visual search preview
  - [x] Disease merging functionality
- [x] **Job Monitoring** - View and trigger scraping jobs
- [x] **Dashboard** - Real-time statistics and system health
- [x] **Scheduling** - Configure scraper schedules

### üî¥ Still Missing
- [ ] Data quality monitoring metrics


## üü¢ Phase 5: Performance & Polish (Future) ?

- [ ] Add caching for metadata schemas and common values
- [ ] Optimize data table for large datasets (virtualization)
- [ ] Add search analytics/telemetry
- [ ] Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, PDF reports)

## üìä Current State Summary (Updated 2025-07-21)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Dynamic Search Interface** - Fully functional with source selection, disease filtering, adaptive columns
- **Advanced API** - Metadata discovery, dynamic values, complex filtering  
- **Working Scrapers** - ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, FDA FAERS, Reddit (needs API creds)
- **Database** - PostgreSQL with full-text search, JSON metadata, pgvector ready (embedding vector(384))
- **Docker Deployment** - All services running with docker-compose + Celery/Redis/Flower
- **Admin Portal** - Complete source/disease management, job monitoring, JWT auth
- **Infrastructure Ready** - WebScraper class with Playwright, configs for forums exist

### üî¥ Critical Gaps
1. **Data Volume** - ONLY 8 DOCUMENTS in database (need 100+)
2. **Scraper Integration** - HealthUnlocked & Patient.info ready but not connected
3. **Journal Sources** - No medical journal scrapers (PLOS, BMJ, PMC)
4. **Semantic Search** - pgvector installed but completely unused
5. **Data Normalization** - No standardization pipeline for inconsistent formats
6. **Pre-scraped Archives** - No seed data for quick population

### üü° Implementation Status by Phase
- **Phase 1** ‚úÖ Core Search - COMPLETE
- **Phase 1.5** üöß Data Collection - IN PROGRESS (4/7+ scrapers working)
- **Phase 2** ‚úÖ Query Builder - COMPLETE 
- **Phase 2.5** ‚ùå Semantic Search - NOT STARTED (pgvector ready but unused)
- **Phase 3** ‚ùå NLP/AI - NOT STARTED
- **Phase 4** ‚úÖ Admin Portal - COMPLETE 
- **Phase 5** ‚ùå Performance - NOT STARTED

### üéØ Next Sprint Goals (Priority Order)
2. **Day 1** - Integrate HealthUnlocked & Patient.info (add to seeds.sql)
3. **Day 2** - Create pre-scraped data archives for seeding
4. **Day 3** - Add journal scrapers (PLOS, BMJ Open, PMC)
5. **Day 4** - Implement basic semantic search with embeddings
6. **Day 5** - Run full scrapes to reach 100+ documents

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Database Schema
- Documents table with JSONB metadata column for flexible source-specific data
- Full-text search indexes (GIN with trigrams) on title/content  
- pgvector extension installed with embedding vector(384) column ready
- Proper constraints to prevent duplicate documents (source_id + external_id)
- Crawl state tracking for incremental updates

### Scraper Architecture  
- BaseScraper class with rate limiting, incremental updates, job tracking
- WebScraper with Playwright support for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Config-driven scrapers using YAML files
- Task integration via Celery for async processing
- Unified document extraction and transformation

### API Design
- FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy and connection pooling
- Dynamic schema discovery from database metadata
- Efficient JSONB querying with PostgreSQL operators
- Unified search endpoint handling all sources
- JWT authentication for admin endpoints

### Frontend Architecture
- React 19 with TypeScript and modern hooks
- TanStack Table v8 for virtualized data grids
- Dynamic component rendering based on DB config
- Real-time search with debounced API calls
- Admin portal with full CRUD operations

### Scalability Considerations
- Celery + Redis for distributed task processing
- Rate limiting per source to respect API limits
- Incremental scraping to minimize redundant requests
- Database indexes optimized for search patterns
- Docker Compose for easy horizontal scaling
