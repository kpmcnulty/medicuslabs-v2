- [ ] **Add High-Value Medical Sources**
  - [ ] FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
  - [ ] European Medicines Agency (EMA) database
  - [ ] Medical journals with open APIs (PLOS, BMJ Open)

### üî¥ High Priority - Data Strategy
- [ ] **Define Scraping Strategy**
  - [ ] DECIDE: Pull-based (scheduled scraping) vs Push-based (webhooks/RSS)
  - [ ] DECIDE: Full re-scrape vs incremental updates only
  - [ ] DECIDE: How to handle rate limits and API quotas
  - [ ] DECIDE: Priority order for sources (reliability vs volume)
- [ ] **Data Structure Decisions**
  - [ ] DECIDE: Unified document model vs source-specific schemas
  - [ ] DECIDE: How to handle structured data (trial phases, lab values)
  - [ ] DECIDE: Metadata standards (MeSH terms, ICD codes, SNOMED)
  - [ ] Define entity relationships (document ‚Üí disease ‚Üí treatment)
- [ ] **Data Normalization Pipeline**
  - [ ] Standardize date formats across sources
  - [ ] Normalize medical terminology (aspirin vs ASA)
  - [ ] Handle dosage extraction and units
  - [ ] Create mapping tables for common variations

## üü° Phase 2: Smart Query Builder (Medium Priority)

### üî¥ Currently Missing
- [ ] **Replace Basic Filters with SmartQueryBuilder**
