### üî¥ Critical Gaps
1. **Data Collection** - Only 2/5 scrapers working, ONLY 8 DOCUMENTS (need 100+)
2. **Forum Scrapers** - HealthUnlocked & Patient.info configs exist but NOT integrated
3. **FDA FAERS** - High-value adverse event data NOT STARTED
4. **Smart Query Builder** - Partially implemented, needs integration
5. **Data Normalization** - No pipeline defined

### üü° Implementation Status by Phase
- **Phase 1** ‚úÖ Core Search - COMPLETE
- **Phase 1.5** üöß Data Collection - IN PROGRESS (blocking progress)
- **Phase 2** üü° Query Builder - PARTIALLY DONE
- **Phase 2.5** ‚ùå Semantic Search - NOT STARTED (pgvector unused)
- **Phase 3** ‚ùå NLP/AI - NOT STARTED
- **Phase 4** ‚úÖ Admin Portal - COMPLETE (done early!)
- **Phase 5** ‚ùå Performance - NOT STARTED

### üéØ Next Sprint Goals
1. Fix Reddit, HealthUnlocked, Patient.info scrapers
2. Add FDA FAERS scraper for adverse events
3. Implement visual query builder with dynamic schema
4. Expand to 100+ documents across all sources
5. Define data normalization pipeline

### üî¥ User Experience Improvements - High Priority
- [ ] **Multi-Disease Selection** - Allow selecting multiple diseases or all diseases, with "Select All" toggle as default
- [ ] **Separate Tables by Data Type** - Show separate tables for each data type (publications, trials, community, FAERS) with type-specific columns instead of mixed data with only shared columns
- [ ] **Data Quality Improvements**:
  - [ ] Show real dates (publication_date, event_date) instead of scraped_date in table columns
  - [ ] Improve metadata display in detail view - structured format instead of raw JSON
  - [ ] Add more meaningful table columns with actionable information
